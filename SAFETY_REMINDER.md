# 🚨 WORK SAFETY REMINDER

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Don't Lose Your Work!**

### **Safe Submission Process:**
1. ✅ Run `python simple_submission.py`
2. ✅ **IMMEDIATELY run `git push`** 
3. ✅ Upload Word doc to Blackboard
4. ✅ Safe to close Codespace

### **⚠️ What Happens If You Skip `git push`:**
- ❌ Work is ONLY saved locally in Codespace
- ❌ Codespace may timeout and DELETE your work
- ❌ You'll have to start over completely
- ❌ No backup, no recovery

### **✅ What `git push` Does:**
- 🛡️ Saves work to GitHub permanently
- 🎯 Triggers auto-grading
- 📊 Creates your official submission
- 🔒 Provides backup you can access anywhere

---
## 🎯 **Remember: `git push` = Submit for Grading!**

Don't just save - **PUSH TO SUBMIT!**
