This assignment tests your understanding of basic programming concepts including variables, data types, and fundamental programming principles.

**Total Points: 100**  
**Questions: 6**  
**Auto-Graded: Yes (instant feedback!)**

## üéØ **Questions You'll Answer**

1. **Programming Terminology** (40 points) - Define key programming terms
2. **High-Level vs Low-Level Languages** (12 points) - Explain the advantages  
3. **Variable Declarations** (12 points) - Write proper Java syntax
4. **Mathematical Operations** (12 points) - Calculate modulo operations
5. **Programming Logic** (12 points) - Write a sphere volume program
6. **Code Debugging** (12 points) - Identify problems in code snippets

## üöÄ **How to Complete This Assignment**

### **Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended - Zero Setup!)**
1. **Open in Codespaces**:
   - Click the green **"<> Code"** button in your repository
   - Select **"Codespaces"** tab
   - Click **"Create codespace on main"**
   - Wait 30 seconds for setup (Python + packages installed automatically)

2. **Complete Assignment**:
   ```bash
   # In the Codespaces terminal, run:
   python simple_submission.py
   ```
   - Answer all 6 questions when prompted
   - Script will auto-save your work to Git (local backup)
   - You'll see: ‚úÖ Work automatically saved to Git!

3. **üî¥ CRITICAL - Submit Your Work (REQUIRED!):**
   ```bash
   # In the Codespaces terminal:
   git push
   ```
   **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you close Codespace without `git push`, you may lose your work!**
   
   The script creates:
   - `assignment1_FirstName_LastName.json` (auto-graded by GitHub)
   - `Assignment1_FirstName_LastName.docx` (upload to Blackboard)

### **Option 2: Local Development**
1. **Clone your repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/assignment-YOUR-USERNAME
   cd assignment-YOUR-USERNAME
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Complete Assignment**:
   ```bash
   python simple_submission.py
   ```

### **Either Way - The Script Will:**
- Ask you questions interactively
- Let you type multi-line code (type 'END' when finished)
- Create your submission files automatically

### **Step 2: Check Your Score**
- Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your GitHub repository
- Click on your latest commit to see auto-grading results
- You'll see scores like: `Q1: 32/40 (80%), Q2: 10/12 (83%)`

### **Step 3: Submit to Blackboard**
- Download the generated Word document (`Assignment1_YourName.docx`) 
- Upload to Blackboard assignment
- This is just proof of submission - your grade comes from GitHub auto-grading

## ‚úÖ **What Gets Created**

After running the script, you'll have:
- `assignment1_FirstName_LastName.json` - Your answers (auto-graded by GitHub)
- `Assignment1_FirstName_LastName.docx` - Word document for Blackboard submission

## üìä **Grading**

Your assignment is **automatically graded** when you push to GitHub:

- **Instant Results**: See your percentage scores immediately
- **Partial Credit**: Get points for partially correct answers
- **Detailed Feedback**: Each question scored separately
- **Final Grade**: Total percentage out of 100 points

## üí° **Tips for Success**

### **For Definitions (Q1)**:
- Give 1-2 sentence explanations
- Use key programming terms in your definitions
- Be specific and accurate

### **For Code Questions (Q3, Q5)**:
- Follow proper Java syntax
- Include all required elements (data types, variable names, values)
- For multi-line code, type 'END' when finished

### **For Calculations (Q4)**:
- Show your work or just provide the final answers
- Double-check your modulo calculations

### **For Debugging (Q6)**:
- Identify specific problems in each code snippet
- Use programming terms like "overflow", "division by zero", etc.

## üõ°Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Preventing Work Loss**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Codespaces Data Safety:**
- **Your work is saved** when you run `python simple_submission.py` (auto-commits to Git)
- **BUT you MUST push** to submit: `git push`
- **Risk**: If you close Codespace without pushing, your work may be permanently lost!

### **Safe Workflow:**
1. ‚úÖ Run `python simple_submission.py` (creates files + auto-saves)
2. ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY run `git push`** (submits for grading)
3. ‚úÖ Upload Word doc to Blackboard
4. ‚úÖ Now safe to close Codespace

### **If You Need to Take a Break:**
- ‚úÖ **Always run `git push` before closing**
- ‚úÖ Your work will be saved and you can resume later
- ‚úÖ Reopen Codespace and continue where you left off

### **Recovery Options:**
- If you forgot to push: Reopen the same Codespace (may still have your work)
- If Codespace was deleted: Start over (this is why we emphasize `git push`!)

## üÜò **Need Help?**

- **Technical Issues**: Make sure Python and `python-docx` are installed
- **Content Questions**: Review your textbook and class notes
- **GitHub Issues**: Check the Actions tab for error messages
- **Office Hours**: Visit instructor office hours for concept clarification

## üîí **Academic Integrity**

- This assignment must represent **your own understanding and work**
- Discussing concepts with classmates is encouraged
- **Individual submissions must be your own**
- Your submission timestamp and commit history are tracked
